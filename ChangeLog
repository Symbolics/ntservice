2005-05-12  Kevin Layer  <layer@gemini>

	* ntservice.cl: Changes from Petr Broz to make interrogation of
	  the service more robust.

2004-02-13    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* ntservice.cl (execute-service): Add call to mp:start-scheduler
	before calling StartServiceCtrlManager.  Required for 7.0 since
	mp:start-customs (which used to start the scheduler) isn't used
	anymore.

2003-12-12    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* ntservice.cl *** Incompatible change made ***
	The function formerly known as start-service is now called
	execute-service.  There is a new function call start-service which
	starts a service (as if the user started it from the Services
	control panel).  There is also a stop-service function now. 

	Changed a bunch of defparameters to defconstants.  Not sure why I
	didn't do that from the start.

	* readme.txt:  Updated to reflect changes and new exported
	functions.

	* testapp.cl:  Changed call of start-service to execute-service.

2003-01-22    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* ntservice.cl (create-service): Added keyword argument :start to
	create-service to control how the service should shart.

	* readme.txt: Updated documentation for above.

2003-01-20    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* ntservice.cl:  

	Added a winstrerror function which takes a
	Windows error code as input and returns an error string (with
	newline at the end).

	Changed some of the foreign function definitions/calls to use the
	:error-value :os-specific return values.  

	Modified the with-open-service macro to allow for finer error
	handling.

	create-service used to error if the CreateService call failed.
	Now it turns (values nil err), where 'err' is the Windows error
	code for the failure.   It returns 't' if all is well.

	delete-service used to error if with-open-service failed or if
	DeleteService failed.  Now it returns 
	(values nil err errplace), where 'err' is the Windows error code
	for the failure and 'errplace' is a string which has the name of
	the API call that actually failed.  It returns 't' if all is well.

	* readme.txt:  Updated to describe the new return values for
	create-service/delete-service.  The example shows use of the new
	return values and a call to ntservice:winstrerror. 

	* testapp.cl: Updated to reflect the create-servic and
	delete-service changes.  Also, it gets the EXE path from the
	command line instead of hard coding it now.  This turns out to be
	very convenient.
